                <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
                <p>I’m a <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> who thrives on building things, breaking things (usually on purpose), 
                    and solving problems that make me question my life choices. 
                    With years of experience and an unhealthy obsession with clean code, 
                    I focus on creating solutions that actually work—and ideally, 
                    don’t require 3 AM bug fixes.
                </p>
                <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll find me on <strong>Football Manager</strong>, 
                    where I’ve spent thousands of hours making questionable transfers 
                    and winning imaginary trophies. Turns out, leading a virtual team to victory isn't too 
                    different from coding—it's all about strategy, patience, and praying nothing crashes.
                </p>
